# MapsVR

MapsVR is an application dedicated to help people with physical 
disabilities navigate the inside of a building.

After seven days of instruction at Kode with Klossy in San Francisco, 
we decided to make our final project using A-Frame and JavaScript. 
This was created by Priyanshi N., Genisis K., and Areeta W.!
