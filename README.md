# MapsVR

"A Google Maps within a Building"

MapsVR is an application dedicated to help people with physical 
disabilities navigate the inside of a building. 

After seven days of instruction at Kode with Klossy in San Francisco, 
we decided to make our final project using A-Frame and JavaScript. 
This web app was created by Priyanshi N., Genesis K., and Areeta W.!
