        <h1 STYLE="margin-top: 100px">Inspiration:</h1>
    
        <p>Our inspiration was Zynga and Google Maps because we found it difficult to find our way to Zynga from BART in the most efficient way without going</p>
    
        <h1>What it does:</h1>
    
        <p>Our goal with MapsVR is to help people with physical disabilities navigate the insides of buildings easily. It could also be used practically for anyone who finds themselves lost or wanting ot plan their exact route in a new area. </p>
    
        <h1>How we built it:</h1>
    
        <p>We used A-Frame combined with Javascript, HTML/CSS to build this webapp. We also used a 360 panoramic phone to gather our images of Zynga. </p>
    
        <h1>Challenges we ran into:</h1>
    
        <p>We had minor issues connecting our CSS page to our HTML and downloading our 3D images of Zynga for A-Frame. We also had some trouble with linking our Javascript file to our HTML page for A-Frame.</p>
    
        <h1>Accomplishments that we're proud of:</h1>
    
        <p>We're proud that we successfully coded our own virtual reality application that can be useful for anyone- whether they are lost or have a disability. And it has the potential to grow and become an app that everyone has on their phones like maps to help them navigate their way inside any building.</p>
    
        <h1>What we learned:</h1>
    
        <p>We learned how to use A-Frame to create a realistic model of the inside of Zynga's headquarters in San Francisco.</p>    
            
        <h1>What's next for MapsVR:</h1>
    
        <p>MapsVR has the potential to branch out and map out the inside of typical public places such as restaurants, malls, public restrooms and transportation methods such as BART, buses, and airports. </p>
    
        <h1>Built With:</h1>
        <p>A-Frame, JS, HTML/CSS</p>
