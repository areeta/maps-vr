        <h1 STYLE="margin-top: 100px">Inspiration:</h1>
    
        <p>Our inspiration was Zynga and Google Maps.</p>
    
        <h1>What it does:</h1>
    
        <p>Our goal with MapsVR is to help people with physical disabilities navigate the insides of buildings easily.</p>
    
        <h1>How we built it:</h1>
    
        <p>We used A-Frame combined with Javascript, HTML/CSS to build this webapp. </p>
    
        <h1>Challenges we ran into:</h1>
    
        <p>We had minor issues connecting our CSS page to our HTML and downloading our images of Zynga for A-Frame.</p>
    
        <h1>Accomplishments that we're proud of:</h1>
    
        <p>We're proud that we successfully coded our own virtual reality application that can be useful for anyone- whether they are lost or have a disability.</p>
    
        <h1>What we learned:</h1>
    
        <p>We learned how to use A-Frame to create a realistic model of the inside of Zynga's headquarters.</p>    
            
        <h1>What's next for MapsVR:</h1>
    
        <p>MapsVR has the potential to branch out to mapping typical public places such as restaurants, parks, public restrooms and transportation methods such as BART, buses, and airports. </p>
